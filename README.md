> **Prompting is not talking to AI. Prompting is programming cognition.**  
This repository is my open sandbox for mastering **prompt engineering as a true engineering discipline**, using tools like **DSPy**, **Python**, and **GitHub** to build **modular, testable, refactorable prompts** — not one-off magic spells.

---

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Treat prompts like **functions**, not fortune cookies
- Develop **reusable frameworks & prompting patterns**
- Learn **DSPy** to structure AI workflows as *declarative programs*
- Grow Python + GitHub fluency alongside prompting workflows
- Train ChatGPT to be a **reliable study buddy for university coursework**

---

## 🎓 Long-Term Objective: Build a Rubric-Aware AI Tutor

Eventually, this project will evolve into:

- 📥 Importing **course rubrics & assignment guidelines**
- 🧠 Teaching AI to **self-check answers against performance criteria**
- 🗣️ Running **Socratic learning sessions** aligned with *graded expectations*
- 🧪 Experimenting with **DSPy pipelines for automated tutoring**

AI shouldn’t just *answer questions*. It should **coach like a professor, explain like a TA, and encourage like a gym bro.**

## 🧪 Philosophy

- **Version it.**
- **Refactor it.**
- **Teach the AI how to think WITH me — not FOR me.**
