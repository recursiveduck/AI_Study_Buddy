> **Prompting is not talking to AI. Prompting is programming cognition.**  
This repository is my open sandbox for mastering **prompt engineering as a true engineering discipline**, using tools like **DSPy**, **Python**, and **GitHub** to build **modular, testable, refactorable prompts** — not one-off magic spells.

---

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Treat prompts like **functions**, not fortune cookies
- Develop **reusable frameworks & prompting patterns**
- Learn **DSPy** to structure AI workflows as *declarative programs*
- Grow Python + GitHub fluency alongside prompting workflows
- Train ChatGPT to be a **reliable study buddy and coach**

## 🧪 Philosophy

- **Version it.**
- **Refactor it.**
- **Teach the AI how to think WITH me — not FOR me.**
